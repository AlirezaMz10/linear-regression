# Linear Regression Project 

## Overview  
This project demonstrates the implementation of **Linear Regression**, a fundamental algorithm in machine learning used for predictive analysis. The code covers the basics of fitting a linear model, understanding its performance, and visualizing the results.

## Features  
- Implementation of simple and multiple linear regression.  
- Data preprocessing and cleaning.  
- Model training and evaluation using metrics like RMSE and R².  
- Visualization of regression lines and residuals.  


## Prerequisites  
- Python 3.x  
- Libraries:
  - `numpy`
  - `pandas`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `scikit-learn`

Install the required libraries using:  
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn 
```


## Getting Started

1.	Clone the repository:

``` https://github.com/AlirezaMz10/linear-regression.git ```

2.	Navigate to the project directory:

``` cd linear-regression ```

3.	Run the script:

``` python linear_regression.py ```


Usage

•	Replace the sample dataset with your own data in .csv format. \
•	Modify hyperparameters and visualize results based on your requirements.
